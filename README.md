# Lost-Ark-Dungeon-bot
This is a working progress for coding a deep learning OpenCv lost ark bot for education learning practise.
The file will be put into a EXE file which is easy to download and use with a clean GUI interface.
This will be updated as I work. 

# Lost-Ark-Dungeon-bot 
You can run the bot in game and be human like movement and move to stage 3 in the dungeon. 
class tested on : 
Berserk - mayham. 

# Update 23/05/2022 anti-bot dectection
working towards an anti-bot dectection that uses deep learning. 
I would need to gather data and display the percentage of a player being a bot or not. 
This will be hard for gathering data in game.
